# Additional Notes


### What is Webpack

Webpack is a front-end tool to build JavaScript module scripts for browsers.

Webpack needs a configuration file called `webpack.config.js` which is just a CommonJS module.

Here's an example webpack config.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './main.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};
```
